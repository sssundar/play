## Exercise Probability & Inference
#### Status: on hold
###### A collection of results I proved and visualized for myself in the 2013-2014, most of which came in very handy for TAing ACM116 in Fall 2014. A problem set I wrote for ACM116 that taught me how much work goes into those beautiful problems in textbooks.

## Exercise Embedded C 
#### Status: ongoing
###### Low-level programming exercises in C following c.learncodethehardway.org & the Caltech CS24 homeworks last year. My eventual goal is to write malloc. 

## Exercise ArduinoMotionTracker
#### Status: on hold
#### Dependency: Embedded C
######   A sound-based motion tracker. It should keep track of my motion patterns as I work and indicate clearly when I don't move from the vicinity for 2 hours or more. This is roughly the frequency at which I'd like to take short walking breaks to maintain productivity in the evenings.
