# play
###### A sequential list of things I want to play with this term.

## Exercise Embedded C 
###### Low-level programming exercises in C following the Caltech CS24 homeworks. One of the exercises should be writing malloc (and testing it on an Arduino). These exercises should set the stage for playing with Arduinos in C. I will use a 32-bit ArchLinux VM, which will also require me to use the git command line rather than the GUI. 

## Exercise ArduinoMotionTracker
######   A sound-based motion tracker. It should keep track of my motion patterns as I work and indicate clearly when I don't move from the vicinity for 2 hours or more. This is roughly the frequency at which I'd like to take short walking breaks to maintain productivity in the evenings.
