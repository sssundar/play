# play
###### A sequential list of things I want to play with this term.

## Exercise LearningC
###### Goal 1: Simple programming exercises in C following the Spring 2015 CS24 homeworks. The aim is to become familiar with the language at a low level. I will use a 32-bit ArchLinux VM, which will also teach me to use the git command line rather than the GUI. 
###### Goal 2: More involved exercises to become familiar with using C for embedded programming, as opposed to assembly. One of the exercises should be writing malloc (and testing it on an Arduino). These exercises should set the stage for playing with Arduinos in C.

## Exercise ArduinoMotionTracker
######   A sound-based motion tracker. It should keep track of my motion patterns as I work and indicate clearly when I don't move from the vicinity for 2 hours or more. This is roughly the frequency at which I'd like to take short walking breaks to maintain productivity in the evenings.
